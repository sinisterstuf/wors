WORS Optimised Reports System

Formerly WRS, the WIS Reports System.
This project is now being re-written from scratch as a cross-platform Eclipse RCP application.
WORS provides a nice user interface which allows teachers to easily collaborate on
school reports with centrally stored data, which are compiled to beautiful PDF documents for printing.

Currently only school reports for international schools following the IB PYP are supported but the
modular project design aims to allow it to be used at any school.

This is an open-source project licensed under GPL-v3, please feel free to join in the fun!
